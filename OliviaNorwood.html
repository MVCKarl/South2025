          </h5>
          <p>
              It has been great watching you go from not wanting to use your left hand to making it look like your prefered hand. It has added
              a new weapon to your game. I love seeing development with people actually using their new skill.

          <p>
              It was fine for you to use your right hand here. Also you got the ball up quick which made it impossible for the defenders to stop

              Defensive Effort - Denying your player the ball
          </h5>
          <p>
              This is an area I really want to see improvement from you in as currently you don't apply enough pressure when your player is next to receive the ball on or around the 3 point line.
              The 3 videos show what I am talking about.

              <br />
              This first video shows no effort at all
          </p>

          <p>
              Here you let your player comfortably catch it and then let her drive straight past her. She goes on to hit both foul shots

              This is a bit better effort but still try to stop her getting the ball so easily

              Defensive Effort - Containing the player
          </h5>
          <p>
              I was pretty disappointed in this effort. You just let the girl go past you with little effort. In games against the top team we need to show fight and need to show we won't let someone just go straight past us.
              These are the plays that can determine whether we win by 1 or lose by 1. Even if you didn't think you were quick enough to stay with her then you should just foul her. You had no fouls for the game so this was the perfect
              time to use up a foul. When you are physical on defensive and offense you really help this team'

              Shot Selection

          <p>
              With this shot you are off balance and the ball has a very low chance of going in. We all have to be careful with our shot selection. If it is going to be a difficult shot instead just pass the ball out

              Happy Feet
          </h5>
          <p>
              This is starting to become a habit where you move both your feet and get called for a travel. Both these videos show it and they both should have been called a travel. You can't move both feet before you dribble the ball. It's something you need to practice at training to get right for games
